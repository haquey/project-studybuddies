Study buddy is an online collaborative notebook that allows students to upload both typed and handwritten notes that will convert them into text stored with various tags using image recognition/natural language processing. This lets students search through their notes with ease instead of flipping through several pages in a binder. Students will be able to share their uploaded files with others to use in their own notebooks if they desire.
